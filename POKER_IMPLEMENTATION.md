## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Security Model
- **Server-Authoritative**: All game logic runs in Cloud Functions
- **Private Data Protection**: Hole cards stored in private sub-collections
- **Validation**: All player actions validated server-side
- **Firestore Rules**: Strict read/write permissions

### Data Structure

#### Firestore Collections
```
/pokerGames/{gameId}
  ├── meta (game configuration)
  ├── status (waiting | playing | finished)
  ├── table (pot, community cards, current round)
  ├── seats (player positions and states)
  └── handNumber

/pokerGames/{gameId}/hands/{handId}
  ├── actions (player action history)
  ├── communityCards
  └── result (winners and payouts)

/pokerGames/{gameId}/private/{userId}
  └── holeCards (visible only to owner)
```

### Real-time Synchronization
- Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners for game state
- Optimistic UI updates for smooth UX
- Automatic reconnection handling
